# Guess Number

# Goal
- To create a number guessing game with the help of some starter code from the Udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann
- https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/

# Functionality
- Randomly selects a secret number from 1 - 20
- Allows the user to type in a number from 1 - 20 into the input field
- 'Check' button tells the user if the number is too high, low, or correct
- Each incorrect attempt will lower the score
- On a correct guess, the high score will be updated if the current score is greater than the high score
- 'Again' button will reset the input field, current score, and create a new secret number
